# Pokemaniac Quiz

A browser-based game to test the player's extensive knowledge of the Pokemon within the games.

Inspired by the amazing Who's That Pokemon Quiz found here https://github.com/Menardi/whosthatpokemon/tree/master

## Development

You will need [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) set up to get the code running locally. You will also need to download the Pokémon images and sounds, because they are not included in this repository. You can download them from https://gearoid.me/pokemon/downloads/pokemedia.zip. Unzip this and put `images/` and `sounds/` in the same directory as `index.html`.

Once you have done this, install the dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

To run the site locally, you can then run:

```
npm run serve
```

To build the site to be deployed online, run:

```
npm run build
```
